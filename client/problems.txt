PROXY - StackOverflow

The reason the react application is still pointing at localhost:3000 is because of cache.
To clear it , follow the steps below.

1. Delete package-lock.json and node_modules in React app
2. Turn off React Terminal and npm install all dependencies again on React App
3. Turn back on React App and the proxy should now be working

This problem has been haunting me for a long time; but if you follow the steps above it should get your React application pointing at the server correctly.
